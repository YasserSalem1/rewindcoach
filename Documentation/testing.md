2. After submission, the system retrieves your profile data and loads the **Profile Overview** page.

Once the data loads, you’ll see the **main dashboard** divided into three sections:

2. **Playstyle Radar Chart** – Visualizes the player’s tendencies (aggressive, farming, objective control, etc.).  
3. **Match History** – Lists the most recent matches, each with a **“Review Match”** button.

## Notes for Judges

- The **first load** may take **10–20 seconds** due to live data fetching from the Riot API.  
- Use **public summoner names** for more consistent test results (e.g., known players).  
- If the rate limit is reached, the app will automatically retry; refreshing after ~30–60 seconds helps.  
- Optimized for **Chrome** and **Edge** on desktop.
- The website is optimised for multiple request by using diffrent riot API Keys, using the website while generating chronicle will work fine.
- Users with non english char or weird symbols MIGHT cause issue while fetching data.
- There are 2 diffrent chatbots in the webapp, each fed diffrent data respectivly Test out their Knowledgd, and check out example of what is being fed in the documentation.
- Review Match chatbot is fed data from match timeline and match info.
- 20 match lab chatbot is fed data from match info, during the last 20 matches
